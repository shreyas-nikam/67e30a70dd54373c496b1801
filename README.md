# NIST AI - Adversarial Machine Learning Lab

This repository contains a Streamlit-based lab for demonstrating adversarial attacks in machine learning. The application is a multi-page interactive tool which showcases:
- Interactive adversarial attack visualizations using Plotly.
- Detailed documentation and explanations regarding the concepts behind adversarial machine learning.
- Integration of open-source libraries like SECML, Foolbox, and ART.

## Features

- **Multi-Page Application**: Seamlessly navigate between an interactive adversarial attack visualizer and data overview/documentation.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Use sliders and controls to adjust attack parameters and see real-time Plotly graph updates.
- **Testing**: Includes both unit tests and integration tests to ensure reliability.
- **Dockerized**: Contains a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for easy containerization.
